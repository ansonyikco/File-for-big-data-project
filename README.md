This project aims to develop a Python program that creates an inverted index for keyword retrieval tasks and generates a word cloud for visualizing word frequency.

Inverted index is a critical data structure that enables fast, efficient, and scalable information retrieval in modern search engines and content management systems. Its ability to quickly locate relevant documents and provide relevance ranking makes it an essential component in the field of information retrieval.

A word cloud, also known as a tag cloud, is a visual representation of text data where the size of each word indicates its importance or frequency within the text. Word clouds are commonly used to quickly identify the most prominent terms in a document, speech, or other form of written communication.

The importance or prominence of a word in a word cloud is typically determined by the following factors:

Frequency: The more often a word appears in the text, the larger it will be displayed in the word cloud.
Relative frequency: The word's frequency is compared to the frequencies of other words in the text. Words that appear more frequently relative to others will be larger.
Relevance: Some word cloud generators may give more weight to words that are deemed more relevant or meaningful to the overall content, even if they don't have the highest raw frequency.
Word clouds can be useful for:

Summarizing the main topics or themes in a document or dataset.
Identifying the most important or buzzworthy terms in a social media discussion or news article.
Visualizing keyword density in search engine optimization (SEO) or content analysis.
Presenting the results of text analysis in an engaging, visual format.

The article dataset from kaggle is used as the data source.
